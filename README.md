# Snake!
INFO 441 Final Project

## Project Proposal
### Summary
We are planning on making a multiplayer snake game. Our game will be a positive distraction for college students who need short breaks from long study hours. Our target audience is mainly students, though anyone who experiences boredom can benefit from our game. This game is a positive distraction and not a hindrance because of its simple nature. Users must be actively engaged to succeed in snake, but itâ€™s not interesting enough for long gameplay. As developers (and students!) we are excited to build this game because we would like to play it ourselves and are looking forward to designing the UI.
